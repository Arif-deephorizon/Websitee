1. Introduction 
Welcome to Deep Horizon (“App”, “Platform”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), operated by Deep 
Horizon Security Technologies Pvt. Ltd. By downloading, accessing, or using Deep Horizon, 
you (“User”, “you”, or “your”) agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). 
If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use or access the app. 
2. Nature of Services 
Deep Horizon is a technology-driven safety companion platform that enables users to: 
• Access real-time safety features, such as emergency alerts, live location sharing, and 
threat detection; 
• Connect with trusted contacts, emergency helplines, and — where available — licensed 
response partners; 
• Receive digital assistance, guidance, and tracking support during distress situations. 
Deep Horizon does not provide or deploy private security personnel directly. Any physical 
security response is coordinated through state-licensed security agencies or public emergency 
responders (e.g., 112) as available. 
3. User Consent & Acknowledgement 
By using the App, you expressly acknowledge that: 
1. Deep Horizon functions as a digital safety companion, not a private security agency. 
2. The platform is an assistive technology, meant to supplement — not replace — police, 
emergency, or professional security services. 
3. Any physical response (if provided) will be executed only by PSARA-licensed 
partners, and Deep Horizon’s role is limited to coordination and communication. 
4. You are responsible for using the app safely and ensuring the accuracy of your profile, 
contacts, and emergency data. 
4. User Responsibilities 
You agree to: 

• Provide accurate registration details; 
• Use the app lawfully and ethically; 
• Not misuse emergency alert systems; 
• Allow access to device permissions (e.g., location, notifications) for proper functioning. 
5. Emergency & Limitations 
While Deep Horizon strives to offer reliable safety features: 
• We do not guarantee immediate emergency response in every circumstance; 
• The service may depend on network, device, and geographic availability; 
• Deep Horizon is not liable for delays, failures, or outcomes of emergency interventions. 
Users are advised to always contact 112 (National ERSS) or local authorities in life-threatening 
situations. 
6. Payments & Subscriptions 
Certain premium features or subscriptions may be offered within the app. All in-app payments 
are governed by the Refund and Cancellation Policy available within the app and on our 
website. 
7. Privacy 
Your personal data is handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy, available in the app and 
at http://www.deephorizon.io/. 
8. Partnerships & Licensing 
Deep Horizon may collaborate with state-licensed private security agencies, law enforcement 
bodies, and verified partners to provide on-ground support. 
Users acknowledge that any such services are rendered under the license of those partners, not 
directly by Deep Horizon Security Technologies Pvt. Ltd. 
9. Limitation of Liability 
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Deep Horizon shall not be liable for: 
• Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use of the app; 
• Delays, communication errors, or non-availability of emergency response; 
• Actions or omissions of third-party agencies or responders. 
10. Termination 

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate user access for misuse, false reporting, unlawful 
conduct, or violation of these Terms. 
11. Governing Law & Jurisdiction 
These Terms are governed by the laws of India. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the courts of Guwahati, Assam.
