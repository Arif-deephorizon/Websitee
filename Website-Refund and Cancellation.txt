This Refund and Cancellation Policy (“Policy”) outlines the terms under which payments, 
subscriptions, and in-app purchases made through the Deep Horizon App are handled. 
The app and all related digital services are owned and operated by Deep Horizon Security 
Technologies Pvt. Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of India (“Company”, “we”, 
“our”, or “us”). 
By purchasing or subscribing to any service or feature on the Deep Horizon App, you agree to 
the terms set out below. 
1. General Terms 
All purchases made through the Deep Horizon App, including subscriptions, credits, and 
premium security features, are non-transferable and, except as provided herein, non-
refundable once confirmed. 
 
We recommend that users carefully review service descriptions, pricing, and plan details before 
completing any transaction. 
2. Cancellation Policy 
2.1. Subscription Cancellations 
Users may cancel their active subscriptions at any time through their respective app store 
accounts: 
• Google Play Store: Play Store → Subscriptions → Deep Horizon → Cancel 
• Apple App Store: Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions → Deep Horizon → Cancel 
Cancellations will stop auto-renewal from the next billing cycle. Users will continue to have 
access to the purchased plan until the current billing period ends. 
Payments already processed for the ongoing cycle are non-refundable. 
2.2. One-Time Purchases and Credits 
For one-time in-app purchases or credit packs, cancellations are not applicable once the 
transaction has been successfully completed. 

3. Refund Eligibility 
Refunds may be issued only under the following verified circumstances: 
3.1. Technical Issues 
If a payment is successfully processed but the corresponding service, plan, or feature is not 
activated or accessible due to a technical error on our platform, a full refund may be issued after 
verification. 
3.2. Duplicate Transactions 
In case of an accidental duplicate charge for the same purchase, the duplicate amount will be 
refunded after confirmation. 
3.3. Service Unavailability 
If a purchased feature or plan becomes unavailable before activation, the user will be entitled to 
a full refund. 
3.4. Annual Subscription Grace Period 
If an annual subscription is cancelled within 7 days of activation and no premium feature or 
emergency service has been used during that period, the user may receive a pro-rata refund. 
4. Non-Refundable Situations 
Refunds will not be issued in the following cases: 
• The service or feature has been successfully activated or used. 
• The user cancels a plan after a premium or emergency feature has been accessed. 
• The refund request is based on subjective dissatisfaction (e.g., change of mind or 
perceived service quality). 
• The user fails to use or access purchased plans or credits within the validity period. 
• The refund request is made after the eligible time window has expired.
